# Python-Twitter-API
Twitter API codes with Twython.

Hi everyone, 

The point is to create a database incrementing hour up to 23 from 0 for a day. 
Then we increment the date. It makes sustainable database that consist of quotes with their 
relativ hours and dates in the future.

After that we build a platform to run the script every hour. 

'twitterapi.py' script checks the database and tweets the quote corresponding to its related date and time.


Inside the Twitter API file you'll see 'insert.py'
